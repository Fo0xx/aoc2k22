# Advent of code 2022 / Aoc2k22

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.
## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies for Aoc2k22, run the following command in the root directory of the project:
```bash
npm install
```
## Usage

To run the program without specifying the day and star level as arguments, use the following command:
```bash
npm run start
```
To specify the day and star level as arguments, use the following command:
```bash
npm run start 1 2
```
This will start the program and automatically load the puzzle for day 1, star level 2.
